Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?

a) Hitting <tab> will bring up commands that start with letters you have already typed.

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install"), or compiled methods?

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

a) Compare the checksum provided by the company with the one in the file.

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?

Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)

a) First downloaded the generic Linux files as rpms. Took me a while to figure out thet Debian systems don't like rpm files, downloaded the debian package. Umbuntu software installer says the package is bad. Try download/unpack again with same result. Read ahead in chapter to the part we're supposed to skip, it mentions you can just apt-get install the files. Do so. It works. :)

2) Document where important files should be.
